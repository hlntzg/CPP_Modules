Default Constructor:

This constructor initializes the _rawValue member to 0.
It is invoked when a Fixed object is created without any arguments.
It also prints a message indicating that the default constructor is called.

Copy Constructor:

The copy constructor is invoked when a new Fixed object is created as a copy of an existing one.
It copies the value of _rawValue from the other object and prints a message confirming the invocation.

Copy Assignment Operator:

The copy assignment operator (operator=) allows you to assign the value of one Fixed object to another.
This operator ensures that the object isn't assigned to itself (via the if (this != &other) check).
It then copies the _rawValue from the other object and prints a message.
Returning *this allows for chaining of assignments like a = b = c.

Destructor:

The destructor is invoked when an object is destroyed (e.g., when it goes out of scope). 
It simply prints a message indicating that the destructor has been called.
This is where any necessary cleanup of dynamic resources would happen (though not needed here with just a simple integer member).

getRawBits() and setRawBits():

These functions are used to get and set the _rawValue of a Fixed object.
getRawBits() returns the current value of _rawValue, and setRawBits() updates it.

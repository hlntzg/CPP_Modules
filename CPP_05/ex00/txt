In C++11 or later, the best approach is to use noexcept instead of throw():

-- throw() is deprecated in C++11 and onwards. The primary reason is that throw() was used to specify that a function does not throw any exceptions, but it was a bit too restrictive and confusing, especially when dealing with inheritance and exception polymorphism.

-- noexcept (modern C++) serves the same purpose but in a more flexible and clearer manner. It means the function is guaranteed not to throw any exceptions.
   It tells that this function is guaranteed not to throw exceptions, improving both safety and performance.

Compiler optimizations:
If a function is marked noexcept, the compiler can make optimizations that assume no exceptions will be thrown, potentially improving performance.
